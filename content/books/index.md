IT/Technology Domain never disappoints to come up with buzz words, be it be the way of working(Agile, Devops, SAFE Methodologies) or way of develping(Microservices, Monolithic) or way of delivering(Automation, Continuous Delivery) or way of running(Serverless, NoOps) etc. This Book helped me to provide more clarity on IT DevOps and Agile Practicality. It explains the tough life of IT operations guys and what are the various gaps in typical IT organisations. It reads like novel which is best part. It focuses on Automation and Continuous delivery and how it can play a crucial role in IT organization success.
